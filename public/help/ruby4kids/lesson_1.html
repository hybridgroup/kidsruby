<article class="lesson"><h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>This is Ruby4Kids</h1>
        <p>Since you are using KidsRuby, you are ready to get started making your first game using Ruby.<br />
        <p>This is the file that will contain our first program.</p>
        <p>We will use the gosu library. </p>
        <p>We will do this by typing:</p>
        <pre><code>require 'gosu'</code></pre>
        <p>We will then start our game by inheriting from the <code>Gosu</code> class</p>
        <p>We will call our game</p>
<pre><code>class MyGame < Gosu::Window
end
</code></pre>
        <p>Now inside of this class, <code>Gosu</code> needs us to define three methods:</p>
        <p>We do this like this:</p>
<pre><code>class MyGame < Gosu::Window
  def initialize
  end

  def update
  end

  def draw
  end
end
</code></pre>
        <p>What happens here is that when the game starts, the <code>initialize</code> method is called.</p>

        <p>Then the game stays running and it goes in a loop, calling the methods: <code>update</code> and <code>draw</code></p>

        <p>Update, then draw, update then draw, update then draw. Like this several times a second.</p>

        <p>OK, so we are almost ready to run this code. The next step that we need to do now is tell <code>Gosu</code> how big a window we want for the game.</p>
        <p>We do this in the <code>initialize</code> method, by passing it three parameters like this</p>
        <pre><code>def initialize(300, 300, false)
end
</code></pre>
        <p>What this does, is make the window 300 pixels wide by 300 pixels high. A pixel is a single dot in your screen. If you put your face right next to the display, you can almost see the dots. Those are called pixels.</p>

        <p>The third parameter you pass to the initialize method is false. This tells gosu not to take over the whole sreen. I hate when games just take over your whole screen. So we will say false for this.</p>

        <p>OK, let's see if this works. Let's run this.</p>

        <p>To run what we have so far, we have to use the class we just defined in our program.</p>

        <p>We do this by adding the following after the class definition.<p>
<pre><code>window = MyGame.new
window.show</code></pre>
        <p>The first line creates an instance of the new game. Then calling the <code>show</code> method, tells the game to show the game window.</p>

        <p>We are ready to run the program now.</p>

        <p>Now, just click on the "Run" button</p>

        <p>If everything worked correctly, you will have seen your screen show up. You have written your first game program!</p>

        <p>Granted, this does not do anything exciting, but at least you now know how to open a window in a computer game.</p>

        <p>The next step will be to add objects to the game.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>The Player</h1>
        <p>It will be good to have a player in the game. So let's create one.</p>

        <p>We do this by adding a new class. I will call it <code>Player</code>.

        <p>Now we will define what our player will do.</p>

        <p>Do this by typing:</p>
        <pre><code>class Player
  def initialize(game_window)
    @game_window = game_window
  end
end
</code></pre>
        <p>Next, we will add an icon to this player so that we can see it on the screen</p>

        <p>We do this by finding a .png picture, I happen to have a picture of an icon and I will place it on an images folder in my game folder. I do this by right clicking on the game folder icon and selecting new folder.<br />
Then I call it images.<br />
Then I drag my image to the screen.<br />
        </p>

        <p>Next, I go to my player class and I add this icon to it. I do this, by typing the following:</p>
          <pre><code>def initialize(game_window)
  @game_window = game_window
  @icon = Gosu::Image.new(@game_window, "images/player1.png", true)
end</code></pre>

      <p>Then we add a draw method to the player. We do this, by typing:</p>
<pre><code>def draw
  @icon.draw(50,50,1)
end</code></pre>
      
      <p>Now, we're almost ready to try this again. I need to go to the <code>MyGame</code> class first, and I need to instantiate this player.</p>

      <p>I do this by typing in the initialize method:</p>
<pre><code>@player1 = Player.new(game_window)</code></pre>

      <p>This tells the player which window to draw itself on.</p>
      <p>Then we add: </p>
      <pre><code>@player1.draw</code></pre>
      <p>in the draw method of the game window.</p>

      <p>This will draw the player when the game is running.</p>

      <p>Let's try it! CLick on the "Run" button. Did it work?</p>
